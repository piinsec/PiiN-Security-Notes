## 🧠 Bug Bounty Tips & Tricks

- 🕳 **Param Discovery**: Combine `gau`, `waybackurls`, and `gf` to find juicy GET parameters.
- 🏰 **Directory Bruteforcing**: Use `ffuf` with good wordlists from SecLists.
- 📜 **Vuln Detection**: Automate scans with `nuclei`, especially using high severity templates.
- 🔍 **Recon**: Use `subfinder` + `httpx` to gather subdomains and active endpoints.
- 🦠 **Exploit WordPress**: Run `wpscan` to detect known CVEs in WordPress.
- 🐍 **SQL Injection**: Use `gf` + `sqlmap` to filter potential SQLi endpoints then exploit them.
- 🧵 **Threads & Speed**: Most tools like `httpx`, `ffuf`, and `nuclei` allow `-t 50` or more for speed.
- 🔁 **Automate Flow**: Combine tools in Bash/PowerShell one-liners or scripts for chain recon.
